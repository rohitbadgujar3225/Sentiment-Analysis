# DeepText Classifier: LSTM-Based Natural Language Processing Model
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to understand and classify text data effectively.

🔍 Key Features:

🧠 LSTM Model: Implements a powerful Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers for sequential text understanding.

🔤 Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, padding, and vocabulary handling using Tokenizer and pad_sequences.

📊 Model Training & Evaluation: Tracks accuracy and loss over epochs, visualized through plots.

📈 Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model using confusion matrix and classification report.

🔄 Prediction Functionality: Allows testing of new inputs using the trained model.
